# ⛽️ Fuel Forecaster – Predicting Fuel Prices at German Gas Stations

**Fuel Forecaster** is a machine learning application built using **XGBRegressor** to accurately predict fuel prices at German gas stations throughout the day, leveraging detailed historical fuel and oil pricing data.

---

##  Project Goals

- **Accurate Intraday Predictions**  
  Due to frequent intraday fuel-price fluctuations in Germany, this project aims to accurately forecast hourly prices, enabling consumers and businesses to optimize fueling schedules and significantly reduce fuel costs.

- **Data-Driven Insights**  
  Combines historical fuel and oil pricing data with temporal (date/time) and location-based features to deliver precise, actionable price forecasts.

- **High Accuracy Target**  
  The primary objective is to forecast hourly fuel prices across all German gas stations within a margin of error of no more than €0.01 (99.99% accuracy).

---

## Long-Term Vision

Our long-term goal is to launch a user-friendly application providing highly accurate and timely fuel-price forecasts. This platform will help both individuals and businesses minimize fuel expenses by intelligently planning refueling times based on intraday price variations.

---

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Real-time Hourly Fuel-Price Forecasts**
- **Germany-wide Coverage**
- **User-Friendly Interface** with intuitive visualization tools
- **Historical Data Analysis** to identify patterns and enhance prediction accuracy
- **Cost-Optimization Recommendations** based on forecasts

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **XGBRegressor (XGBoost)** – for predictive modeling
